# Barrel

Barrel is a system tray tool that allows you to open “Barrels” — groups of
applications, configured with text files.  It can launch applications,
files, websites, powershell scripts, and more.

Barrel is heavily inspired by Brett Terpstra's
[Bunch](https://bunchapp.co), which is sadly MacOS only.


## Usage

To use Barrel, create a file (eg `work.barrel`) in the barrels folder and
in it list your applications. You can create as many barrels as you wish.
